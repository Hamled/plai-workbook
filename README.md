# Workbook for PLAI2
This repo contains my non-project code while working through the textbook [Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/) 2nd Edition.

It may also include some assignments from the online version of Brown's [CS 1730 course](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/OnLine/).
